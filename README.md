# Only-Connect-Discord-Bot
This repository uses the Discord PY package for Python to create a Discord bot which can be used to play Only Connect quizzes in a Discord channel. 

Questions from all four rounds of the show can be played. A future version of this bot will have a full game round where two teams can play each round against each other for points. 

To add the bot to your Discord server, please use the following link. https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1069636173997277204&permissions=947043564544&scope=bot

The bot is currently deployed on an free tier AWS EC2 instance, with lists of questions stored in an AWS S3 bucket. If anyone would like to contribute to the questions, please get in touch.
